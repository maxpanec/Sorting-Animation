# Sorting-Animation
Completed project July 2021.

Top of the application is a control bar which contains buttons for bubble, selection, insertion, quick, and merge sort as well as textboxes for the milliseconds between comparisons and the amount of numbers to be sorted.
Different colors are utilized to represent sorted portion of array, unsorted portion, and elements being compared.
